You are given a set  and  other sets.
Your job is to find whether set  is a strict superset of each of the  sets.

Print True, if  is a strict superset of each of the  sets. Otherwise, print False.

A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.

Example
Set is a strict superset of set.
Set is not a strict superset of set.
Set is not a strict superset of set.

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated elements of set .
The second line contains integer , the number of other sets.
The next  lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.

Constraints

Output Format

Print True if set  is a strict superset of all other  sets. Otherwise, print False.

Sample Input 0

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 23 45 84 78
2
1 2 3 4 5
100 11 12
Sample Output 0

False
Explanation 0

Set  is the strict superset of the set but not of the set because  is not in set .
Hence, the output is False.-----------------------------
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
A = set(map(int, input().split()))
n = int(input())
is_strict_superset = True
for _ in range(n):
    other_sets= set(map(int,input().split()))
    if not(A>other_sets):
        is_strict_superset = False
        break
print(is_strict_superset)
